Of general interest: 
- Jupyter notebooks for a class on [idealized modeling](https://github.com/LDEO-CREW/EESC-6926-Idealized-models-Spr-23) 
in earth science taught with [Galen McKinley](https://mckinley.ldeo.columbia.edu)
- A pure Python [implemenation of the Discrete Ordinates method](https://github.com/LDEO-CREW/Pythonic-DISORT) 
for computing the intensity field, based on the 
[DISORT Fortran code](http://www.rtatmocn.com/disort/) developed by Knut Stamnes and collaborators since the late 1980s.  
Installable with `pip`.
- [A guide](https://github.com/LDEO-CREW/CESM2-ginsburg) to bulding and  running NCAR's CESM2
